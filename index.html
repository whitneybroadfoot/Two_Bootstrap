      <p class="mb-0">Thanks for visiting my page, I'm going to share a little bit about myself! My name is Whitney and
        I live in Denver, Colorado with my husband, Jesse. In my free time I enjoy being
        outside, trying new things, traveling, and spending time with my family and friends. My current goal is to visit
        all 50 States and I have four more to go; Alaska, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. Originally my heart was
        set on all the Continents, but after Morocco I had to reevaluate. Turns out getting to Antarctica is super
        expensive, and America is pretty cool!
        <br>
        <br>
        Originally from Saranac Lake, New York I grew up in part of the Adirondack National Park. Unlike most land
        preserves, about fifty percent of the 6.1 milion acres is privately owned and habitated by people. There are
        more than 10,000 lakes and 30,000 miles of rivers and streams. This is the one thing that makes living in a land
        locked State difficult for me, but you can't beat that Colorado sunshine. Before moving to Denver, I was living
        in Brooklyn, NY so I got a crash course in City living. The thing I miss most about New York City is the people
        watching, bagels, and public transportation. Denver traffic has definitely changed in the seven short years I
        have lived here, and I wish RTD was more diversified.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently I am enrolled at Denver University for their Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. I am most looking forward to
        the creative side of coding once I learn the basics. There is a lot of buzz about an emerging "travel tech"
        industry in Denver, so I would like to use new skills to
        explore my options with that. I previously worked within the production side of Evening News and I can relate to
        the importance of proper structure. Within the show rundowns, camera robotics, or TelePrompter controls, it was
        always crucial to follow the frameworks in place. During breaking news you don't have a lot of time to adapt, so
        the proper systems in place become extremely important.
        <br>
        <br>
        Please follow along as I update my Portfolio! I am excited to continue my persuit of education within the realm
        of web development and coding to see where this new career path will take me.
