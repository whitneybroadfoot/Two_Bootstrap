## Assignment Overview
When web developers find themselves repeating a task, they often look for programmatic solutions. A prime example is setting up boilerplate HTML and CSS that can be reused. In the previous unit, you built and deployed a simple portfolio site. Now imagine that you're building portfolios for several clients. An efficient approach to this scenario would be to create a master stylesheet and then customize copies of it for each portfolio. In doing so, you'd be implementing a simple CSS framework.
CSS frameworks allow us to quickly style a web application so we can focus on bootstrapping it (i.e., building and deploying the business logic). Most CSS frameworks handle the more challenging aspects of CSS for us, such as floats and media queries. Another benefit of using CSS frameworks is that it ensures consistency across applications. Depending on your career trajectory, you may find yourself maintaining multiple web applications and, as you learned in the previous unit, CSS can get unruly very quickly. As applications scale, being able to easily maintain and organize your codebase becomes very important.
The CSS framework we'll use in this course is Bootstrap. Bootstrap was one of the first CSS frameworks and is, at the time of this writing, the most widely used in production. It was created by the developers at Twitter for the reasons discussed above and released as an open source project in 2011, meaning anyone could use it in their applications for free. There are dozens of CSS frameworks to choose from now. Learning Bootstrap will set you up to quickly adapt to almost any framework as they tend to share the same underlying concept of a grid system structured by rows and columns.
